# Adrià Vilanova Martínez – @avm99963

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My repos have a new home at Gerrit:

* [Directory of repositories - Gitiles](https://gerrit.avm99963.com/plugins/gitiles/)
* [Code review - Gerrit](https://gerrit.avm99963.com/q/-is:wip)

Under my Github username you'll see clones/mirrors of those repos, as well as forks I use to collaborate with other open-source projects here at GitHub, and some old repos I haven't migrated to Gerrit.

## About myself

I'm a Mathematics student at the Polythecnic University of Catalonia and a Physics students at the University of Barcelona. I began self-learning about web development in 2011, and since then I've been learning more and more about IT, with a combination of self-learning and the subjects I've been coursing at university (Introduction to Computer Science, Algorithms, Numerical Linear Algebra, and Numerical Calculus).
