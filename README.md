# Adrià Vilanova Martínez – @avm99963

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm in the process of moving my GitHub repos to a Gerrit instance in my server, but you'll be able to see exact clones of the Gerrit repos here, and you'll also be able to see all of the repos which I still haven't moved there.

This is the new home for my repos at Gerrit:

* [Directory of repositories - Gitiles](https://gerrit.avm99963.com/plugins/gitiles/)
* [Code review - Gerrit](https://gerrit.avm99963.com/)

## About myself

I'm a Mathematics student at the Polythecnic University of Catalonia and a Physics students at the University of Barcelona. I began self-learning about web development in 2011, and since then I've been learning more and more about IT, with a combination of self-learning and the subjects I've been coursing at university (Introduction to Computer Science, Algorithms, Numerical Linear Algebra, and Numerical Calculus).
